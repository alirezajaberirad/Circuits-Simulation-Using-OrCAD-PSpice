# Circuits-Simulation-Using-OrCAD-PSpice
The final project of the Electric Circuits 1 course - Fall 2018

In this assignment, I simulated the circuit shown in the "Circuit.png" in the OrCAD PSpice program. As you can see in the picture, the voltage and current of each node are reported. OrCAD PSpice files of the mentioned simulation are provided in a separate folder.
